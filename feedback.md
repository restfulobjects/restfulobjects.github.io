## Feedback

Even though v1.0.0 of the Restful Objects spec has now been issued, we intend to continue working on the spec, clarifying it, enhancing it, and adopting new and emerging standards where appropriate. As such, we always welcome your feedback, either via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/restfulobjects/restfulobjects-spec/issues) on github, or just by commenting here.

If you want to reference the spec on Twitter, please use the `#restfulobjects` hashtag.
