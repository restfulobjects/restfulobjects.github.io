## Implementations

There are currently two implementations of frameworks that implement the spec, allowing a RESTful API to be automatically generated from a domain object model.

* [Apache Isis](http://isis.apache.org) is a full-stack open source application development framework, designed to let you rapidly develop domain-driven business enterprise applications, for the Java platform.  Its [Restful Objects viewer](http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugvro.html) component implements the REST API defined by the spec.

* [Naked Objects framework](https://github.com/NakedObjectsGroup/NakedObjectsFramework) runs on the .NET platform, and implements the 'naked objects pattern'.  It was the first framework to fully implement this spec.
